# Angular
Task2 replicate ARC Landing page using Angular
## Getting started
Make sure you have the Angular CLI installed globally. We use Yarn to manage the dependencies, so we strongly recommend you to use it. you can install it from Here, then run yarn install to resolve all dependencies (might take a minute).

Run ng serve for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
